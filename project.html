            NikGapps project started with the goal to provide custom gapps
            packages that suits everyone's needs. A package that a user needs
            but cannot find and ends up setting up the device installing more
            apps and removing unwanted apps manually.
          </p>
        </div>

        <ul class="nikgapps__features__list">
          <li>
            NikGapps is a gapps package built from my own device. As my device
            is always updated with latest version of Google Apps, every time I
            build a new package, I am on latest version of Google Apps.
          </li>
          <li>
            NikGapps is a bit different than other Gapps packages. It focuses
            on providing apps that most of the people uses but can't find it
            in other Gapps packages and ends up installing the apps manually.
          </li>
          <li>
            NikGapps doesn't have stock YouTube, instead it has YouTube
            vanced. It doesn't have Pixel Launcher, instead it has Lawnchair
            launcher
          </li>
          <li>
            It also allows optimizing Google Play Services (when you turn off
            Find My Device) so that you can sleep with peace without having to
            worry about Google play services eating your battery.
          </li>
          <li>
            Just like OpenGapps, it allows you to dirty flash it anytime you
            want. It also supports addon.d so you need not flash the package
            again and again after every nightly flash.
          </li>
          <li>
            NikGapps comes with nikgapps.config file (can be found at
            /sdcard/NikGapps folder) which allows you to configure your
            installation. Now you can control the installation the way you
            desire.
          </li>
          <li>
            NikGapps offers separate addon.d scripts for each package that it comes with. Easy to control which package
            you want to restore after dirty flash!
          </li>
          <li>
            NikGapps also comes with debloater.config file (can be found at 
            /sdcard/NikGapps folder) which allows you to configure the apps/files 
            you would like to debloat. The same is persistent across dirty flashes.
